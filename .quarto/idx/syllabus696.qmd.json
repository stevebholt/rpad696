The MPA curriculum emphasizes the development of technical and managerial skills toward the responsible and ethical uses of discretion in the pursuit exemplary personal and organizational performance (see @sec-appendix for a list of the competencies). The MPA's mission and curriculum reflects the faculty's commitment to producing committed and engaged public servants whose actions embody public service ideals.\n\nRPAD 696 \"Integrative Capstone\" is the culmination of this learning process. As such, during this course, students will apply the competencies, knowledge, and skills they have acquired throughout the program to a semester-long case study project in a fictional setting. Course assignments will require students to synthesize and apply skills and material from across the MPA curriculum, individually and in teams. Toward that end, students will be preparing a semester-long research report for a client that will detail the knowledge base about a particular policy issue, develop a description of the status quo and two policy alternatives, present data and evidence regarding the expected effects and costs of the alternatives, and conclude with a recommendation to the client.\n\n### Required Materials\n\nThe course materials will all be shared through the course Brightspace and this course site. The materials will generally be assignment instructions and helpful supplemental materials.\n\n### Course Structure\n\nAs a capstone class, this class is centered around two primary assignments:\n\n1.  An individual assignment to produce a segment of the analysis for the case study final report.\n2.  A group assignment to produce a final report - a section of which will be drawn from the individual assignment.\n\nUnlike most courses, this course is ensuring an application and synthesis of program skills and materials. As a result, there are not weekly modules and not necessarily new skills or content taught week to week. Instead, we will follow a biweekly meeting schedule (see detailed course schedule below) and most meetings will allow for groups to coordinate their work in-person and ask any questions they might have of the instructor. \n\n## Assignments\n\n### Individual Assignment\n\nAs an individual, students will write two 1-2 page (single spaced, 12 point Times New Roman font) memos based on the final report they are making to the client. Each memo should be targeted at two different stakeholders - one that will be supportive of the recommendation and one that may be oppositional to some or all of the recommendation you are making. Your memo should be structured to summarize your report and final recommendations, but should be tailored to the specific stakeholder in how the information is presented. The individual assignment will be due **December 10th** alongside the final group assignment report and details for completing the assignment will be provided on Brightspace and the course site during the first week of classes.\n\n### Group Assignment\n\nThe group assignment will have four deliverables: 1) a group roles contract (details will be provided on Brightspace) submitted for instructor review (due **September 29th**); 2) an outline of the group's approach to the case (due **October 13th**); 3) the final research report (due **December 10th**); and 4) a group final presentation and a polished presentation from all members (due **December 10th**).\n\n### Grading\n\nThe course grade consists of:\n\n-   Group contract: 10 points\n-   Final report: 30 points\n-   Individual assignment: 30 points\n-   Presentations: 20 points\n-   Peer evaluations: 10 points\n\n## Detailed Course Schedule\n\n| Date | Assignment | Readings |\n|:-------------:|:---------------------------------------:|:-------------:|\n| 8/25 | First class - Introduction and Syllabus | | \n| 9/29 | Group Roles Contract and Client Selection Due |  |\n| 10/6 | Writing Literature Reviews |  |\n| 10/13 | 1-page outline of group appraoch |  |\n| 10/31 | Comparing Alternatives and Analysis |  |\n| 11/14 | Stakeholders and Political Analysis | |\n| 12/10 | Final presentations, final reports due | |\n\n::: callout-note\n**NOTE:** I will be adding materials to both the Brightspace and the Course site on working in groups, delivering presentations, and the expectations for the final report. I will post announcements to the class when such updates and materials are posted.\n:::\n\n## Class Policies\n\n-   Public policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\n-   Letters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\n-   I have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\n-   **HAVE FUN!** Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\n-   The table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\n-   Students with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n::: callout-important\n**NOTE:** Throughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n:::\n\nTable.

Each assignment is weighted by the proportion of the final grade made up by the assignment itself, as described above.\n:::\n\n### Academic integrity\n\nAcademic honesty is something your professor takes very seriously. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university's academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university's academic honesty policies, visit the [site](http://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity).\n\n### Students with Disabilities\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students.
