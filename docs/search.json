The MPA curriculum emphasizes the development of technical and managerial skills toward the responsible and ethical uses of discretion in the pursuit exemplary personal and organizational performance (see the appendix for a list of the competencies). The MPA‚Äôs mission and curriculum reflects the faculty‚Äôs commitment to producing committed and engaged public servants whose actions embody public service ideals.\nRPAD 507 ‚ÄúIntegrative Capstone‚Äù is the culmination of this learning process. As such, during this course, students will apply the competencies, knowledge, and skills they have acquired throughout the program to a semester-long case study project in a fictional setting. Course assignments will require students to synthesize and apply skills and material from across the MPA curriculum, individually and in teams.\n\n\nThe course materials will all be shared through the course Brightspace and this course site. The materials will generally be assignment instructions and helpful supplemental materials.\n\n\n\nAs a capstone class, this class is centered around two primary assignments:\n\nAn individual assignment to produce a segment of the analysis for the case study final report.\nA group assignment to produce a final report - a section of which will be drawn from the individual assignment.\n\nAs with all online courses, there is not a weekly meeting time and your group work will be conducted and coordinated with each other. However, unlike most online courses, this course is ensuring an application and synthesis of program skills and materials. As a result, there are not weekly modules. Instead, when the course transitions to the group assignment (March 1st), groups will be expected to meet with the instructor bi-weekly to provide a progress report on their capstone work. The final report will be developed in segments and the bi-weekly check-ins will ensure groups are on track and receive the advice and instruction they need. Groups will sign-up for 30 minute office hour blocks using the link in the header (or here). For any particular meeting, groups can either designate an attendee to bring the update to office hours and pass on feedback or attend as a group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an individual, students will write a 6 page (single spaced, 12 point Times New Roman font) stakeholder analysis based on the case study provided to the class. The assignment should open with a 1 page description of the budgetary decision being made and a 5 page stakeholder assessment of the important stakeholders to engage for the decision to be successful. The individual assignment will be due February 28th and details for completing the assignment will be provided on Brightspace and the course site during the first week of classes.\n\n\n\nThe group assignment will have four deliverables: 1) a group roles contract (details will be provided on Brightspace) submitted for instructor review (due March 8th); 2) an outline of the group‚Äôs approach to the case (due March 20th); 3) the final case study report (due May 4th); and 4) a group final presentation video, which can be done as a recorded Zoom with screenshare for slides and a polished presentation from all members (due May 4th).\n\n\n\nThe course grade consists of:\n\nStakeholder analysis (35%)\nFinal Report (35%)\n\nOutline (5%)\nContract (5%)\nPeer Evaluation (10%)\nReport (15%)\n\nFinal Presentation (15%)\nCompletion of Peer Evaluation (15%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nAssignment\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n4/28\nStakeholder Analysis Due\n\n\n\n3/8\nGroup Roles Contract Due\n\n\n\n3/7 or 3/9\nFirst Group Check-In\n\n\n\n3/20\n1-page outline of group appraoch\n\n\n\n4/4 or 4/6\nSecond Group Check-In\n\n\n\n4/18 or 4/20\nFinal Group Check-In\n\n\n\n5/4\nFinal Report and Final Presentation Due\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNOTE: I will be adding materials to both the Brightspace and the Course site on working in groups, delivering presentations, and the expectations for the final report. I will post announcements to the class when such updates and materials are posted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\nLetters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\nI have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\nHAVE FUN! Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\nThe table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\nStudents with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNOTE: Throughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n\n\nTable.

Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies, visit the site.\n\n\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students. This includes students with physical, sensory, medical, cognitive, learning, mental health, and other disabilities. If you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services (DAISS) by emailing daiss@albany.edu or calling 518 -442-5501. DAISS staff will explain the documentation and registration process, and set you up with an appointment.

Information about the Writing Center can be found at their site.\n\n\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies prohibit offenses defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), sexual exploitation, and stalking. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies apply to the entire University at Albany community, including students, faculty, and staff of all gender identities.

The date for the completion of the work is specified by the instructor. The date stipulated will not be later than one month before the end of the session following that in which the Incomplete is received. The grade I is automatically changed to E or U unless work is completed as agreed between the student and the instructor.\n\n\n\nStudents are excused, without penalty, to be absent because of religious beliefs, and will be provided equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. Students should notify the instructor of record in a timely manner, and the instructor will work directly with students to accommodate religious observances. Online courses will not schedule any assignment deadlines on religious holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn MPA graduate from Rockefeller College will be able to energize people and resources in the pursuit of publically defined policy goals in a manner that respects multiple perspectives and recognizes consequences of their actions.\nWithin organizations, our MPA graduates will:\n\nDemonstrate leadership in personal work and group settings.\nPrioritize activities in a manner consistent with organizational strategy and performance goals, regardless of their position in the hierarchy.\nFacilitate, plan, and manage projects to meet organizational goals.\n\nTo those outside of their organizations, our MPA graduates will:\n\nDisplay responsible stewardship of public resources and accountability to the public interest.\nCoordinate actions with multiple organizations.\nNavigate the competing interests of other governmental and non-governmental actors.\n\n\n\n\nAn MPA graduate from Rockefeller College will substantively participate in the design, implementation, and evaluation of public policy.

Under the County‚Äôs budget development calendar, executive agencies begin to develop their budget priorities for the upcoming year in early February and submit their proposals to the County Executive‚Äôs office in early May. By law, the County Executive must submit his or her budget recommendation to the County Legislature by August 15th, for review (including at least one public hearing) and adoption prior to the start of the new fiscal year on September 1st. For the purposes of this assignment, you are delivering your recommendations as a report and presentation on May 4th. Of course, before generating a final report and set of recommendations, your agency will of course want to touch base with the community to get feedback and thoughts on your plan for the budget reductions. For this assignment - due on February 28th - you will be creating a proposed set of budget changes, identifying important stakeholders for engagement, and developing a plan for engaging stakeholders. You will be drawing on the case detailed in Stratton County.",

    "section": "Details",
    "text": "Details\nYour submission will involve three sections: a 1-page memo outlining your budget proposal, a 2-page summary of the major stakeholders that will be relevant to the budget decisions you‚Äôve made, and a 3-page summary of how you will engage your stakeholders.\n\nBudget Memo\nIn your one page budget memo, you need to briefly and precisely establish two things. First, you need to outline where all of the cuts to the operating budget will be coming from and how you anticipate services to be impacted. Second, you need to explain why those areas were identified for reduction. Note that if you make any other accompanying changes to the budget, those should include those in this memo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Budget Creativity\n\n\n\nWhile budgets are not often thought of as expressions of high art, as you have hopefully learned throughout your time here, there is room for creativity in public budgeting. When making decisions, note that it‚Äôs possible to reduce some areas more than necessary and use the additional reduction to invest new resources somewhere else even in a time of overall budget reductions. Just a useful (though not required or always needed) tool to keep in mind.\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder Analysis\nIn RPAD 500 (Foundations of Public Administration), you almost certainly read the Eden and Ackermann (1998) chapter on stakeholder analysis. Here, you will once again be thinking about stakeholders using their framework - identify the four most important stakeholders given your budget proposal while considering their power to raise opposition or support to your efforts and their interest in the outcome of the final budget. In your analysis, be sure to detail the basis on which you are assessing each stakeholder‚Äôs power and interest and whether they will be opponents or supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhile this is based on a fictional case, remember that it was designed on real-world cases. When considering stakeholders‚Äô power and interest, do some research to ground your assessments. In similar budget situations, who tends to be most vocal and powerful according to research? How do similar groups behave or react in similar situations in other cities? What typically gets their support? A good analysis will ground itself in concrete measures and ways to think critically about the world.\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nAlso in RPAD 500, you likely read Fung (2003) and created a plan for engaging stakeholders before. In this assignment, you will once again be rolling out a plan for engaging your stakeholders. You will provide details about a schedule of meetings, outreach, a timeline for feedback and how feedback will be used, where and when meetings will be held, and how those meetings will be structured. More importantly, you will need to link this plan and its details to your budget goals and analysis of your stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Strategic Engagement\n\n\n\nOne way to ensure productive engagement is to have a plan going in for how you will handle opposition. Identify some aspects of your budget proposal that are negotiable without activating too much opposition elsewhere. Another important aspect of strategy is clarifying and articulating what you hope to get out of the engagement. Is this collecting feedback or trying to bring awareness and context to a decision? Your approach should align with what you hope to get out of the engagement.",
