    "text": "üë®‚Äçüè´: Stephen Holt, Ph.D.\nüìÖ: Thursdays, 6:00-8:50 pm, Husted 014\nüìß: sbholt@albany.edu\nüè´: Mondays and Wednesdays from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm or by appointment - book here; in-person in Milne 324 or online in GatherTown.1\n‚òéÔ∏è: 518-442-3309\n\n\n\nThe mission of the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy Master of Public Administration (MPA) Program is to develop leaders, managers, and advanced analysts who excel in public service within government and across sectors. The MPA curriculum emphasizes the development of technical and managerial skills toward the responsible and ethical uses of discretion in the pursuit exemplary personal and organizational performance (see Section¬†1.6 for a list of the competencies). The MPA‚Äôs mission and curriculum reflects the faculty‚Äôs commitment to producing committed and engaged public servants whose actions embody public service ideals.\nRPAD 696 ‚ÄúIntegrative Capstone‚Äù is the culmination of this learning process. As such, during this course, students will apply the competencies, knowledge, and skills they have acquired throughout the program to a semester-long case study project in a fictional setting. Course assignments will require students to synthesize and apply skills and material from across the MPA curriculum, individually and in teams. Toward that end, students will be preparing a semester-long research report for a client that will detail the knowledge base about a particular policy issue, develop a description of the status quo and two policy alternatives, present data and evidence regarding the expected effects and costs of the alternatives, and conclude with a recommendation to the client.\n\n\nThe course materials will all be shared through the course Brightspace and this course site. The materials will generally be assignment instructions and helpful supplemental materials.\n\n\n\nAs a capstone class, this class is centered around two primary assignments:\n\nAn individual assignment to produce a segment of the analysis for the case study final report.\nA group assignment to produce a final report - a section of which will be drawn from the individual assignment.\n\nUnlike most courses, this course is ensuring an application and synthesis of program skills and materials. As a result, there are not weekly modules and not necessarily new skills or content taught week to week. Instead, we will follow a biweekly meeting schedule (see detailed course schedule below) and most meetings will allow for groups to coordinate their work in-person and ask any questions they might have of the instructor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an individual, students will write two 1-2 page (single spaced, 12 point Times New Roman font) memos based on the final report they are making to the client. Each memo should be targeted at two different stakeholders - one that will be supportive of the recommendation and one that may be oppositional to some or all of the recommendation you are making. Your memo should be structured to summarize your report and final recommendations, but should be tailored to the specific stakeholder in how the information is presented. The individual assignment will be due May 8th alongside the final group assignment report and details for completing the assignment will be provided on Brightspace and the course site during the first week of classes.\n\n\n\nThe group assignment will have four deliverables: 1) a group roles contract (details will be provided on Brightspace) submitted for instructor review (due February 6th); 2) an outline of the group‚Äôs approach to the case (due March 6th); 3) the final research report (due May 8th); and 4) a group final presentation and a polished presentation from all members (due May 8th).\n\n\n\nThe course grade consists of:\n\nGroup contract: 10 points\nFinal report: 30 points\nIndividual assignment: 30 points\nPresentations: 20 points\nPeer evaluations: 10 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nAssignment\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n1/23\nFirst class - Introduction and Syllabus\n\n\n\n2/6\nGroup Roles Contract and Client Selection Due\n\n\n\n2/20\nWriting Literature Reviews; Group meetings\n\n\n\n3/6\n1-page outline of group appraoch\n\n\n\n3/27\nComparing Alternatives and Analysis; Group meetings\n\n\n\n4/10\nStakeholders and Political Analysis; Group meetings\n\n\n\n4/24\nFinal check-in; Group meetings\n\n\n\n5/8\nFinal presentations, final reports due\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNOTE: I will be adding materials to both the Brightspace and the Course site on working in groups, delivering presentations, and the expectations for the final report. I will post announcements to the class when such updates and materials are posted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\nLetters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\nI have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\nHAVE FUN! Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\nThe table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\nStudents with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNOTE: Throughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n\n\nTable.

Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies, visit the site.\n\n\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students.

The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies prohibit offenses defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), sexual exploitation, and stalking. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies apply to the entire University at Albany community, including students, faculty, and staff of all gender identities.

Here, you will once again be thinking about stakeholders using their framework - consider your two stakeholders regarding their power to raise opposition or support to your efforts and their interest in the outcome of the final recommendation. Your tailored messaging should be clearly aligned with the assessment of the stakeholders in your group‚Äôs report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhile you are not actually working with the clients chosen by your group, try to approach this as if you were and you are engaging important stakeholders on their behalf in messaging the recommended decision. When considering stakeholders‚Äô power and interest, do some research to ground your assessments. In similar budget or policy situations, who tends to be most vocal and powerful according to your research? How do similar groups behave or react in similar situations in other cities or states? What typically gets their support? A good analysis will ground itself in concrete measures and ways to think critically about the world.",

    "section": "Details",
    "text": "Details\nIn the following, I lay out the sections that should be included in your 20 page (or less) report plus a one-page executive summary, in order, with details on expectations for each section. Overall, the format should use APA citation formatting (for both in-text citations and references list), 12-point Times New Roman font, and single-spaced. The first page should be a cover sheet with a title and all group member names clearly printed.\n\nExecutive Summary\nThis section does not count toward your page count. The report must include a 1-page, single-spaced summary of the full report. The summary should lay out the problem, guiding principles for the solution, the three alternative approaches considered, and finally, the final recommendation. Be clear and concise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMany students find summarizing their extended research in a limited space challenging, but such summarizing is an important skill to build. A big part of being prepared in a professional role is doing all the work to get to your answer, knowing how you got to your answer well enough to answer clarifying questions, and identifying for yourself and others what is truly important for making a particular decision. Remember that in this context, there‚Äôs a full report detailing your process and thinking that will follow the summary; it‚Äôs okay for the summary to leave details out to get to the bottom-line points.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nA 1-2 page introduction that should resemble the executive summary, but with added details on how you approached the problem and how the remainder of the report is structured. A good introduction should provide readers a clear understanding of how you are defining the problem, how you are proposing to resolve the problem, how you are weighing solutions, and the process by which you analyzed your options (e.g., what data did you use? what criteria were policies judged against?). Note that professional reports are not mystery novels - readers should know your final conclusion by the end of the introduction.\n\n\nBackground and Related Research\nA 4-6 page summary of research that informs your decision-making. Your research should center on what the evidence says about the policy problem your client is tackling (e.g., the effects of congestion and current congestion rates; housing supply and housing affordability nationally; or current land-use and economic activity in a downtown area), the evidence regarding the status quo and the two policy alternatives you are weighing (your client‚Äôs and the additional alternative), what has been successful in similar cases in other areas/cities/states/countries, and any evidence that describes the size and direction of effects of these policies to anchor your own projections later in the report. Do not quote articles or materials directly. Instead, summarize the literature in your own words with citations to works appropriately placed throughout the text.\nThis section should close with a table or figure that describes the problem as it stands now or in recent years using data you download and analyze yourself, and your should write a clear description of the problem using insights from the table and data. Note that you should also describe the data - what data did you use? what years? where did you get it from? what variables did you include? - in this last part of this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Data\n\n\n\nThe Current Population Survey, American Community Survey, and other similar data from Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics will likely be good sources. For local or state government issues, you may have to look around city or state government sites or identify only data from the relevant cities or states in the national datasets listed above. These data can be found on the Census website or, more readily for your needs, on IPUMS (for instance, the IPUMS CPS can be found here but a Google search for ‚ÄúIPUMS ACS‚Äù or ‚ÄúIPUMS NHIS‚Äù will bring up the IPUMS repository of those government datasets as well). This analysis can be as simple or as sophisticated as you like - I just would like to see you apply the analytic skills learned in your data analysis classes in the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Research Basics\n\n\n\nA good approach to doing the background research is to create a list of broad, general search terms that inform the basic themes of what you are doing. For example, if researching a new effort to assign bonuses to good teachers, I would include: ‚Äúteacher effectiveness,‚Äù ‚Äúteacher pay,‚Äù ‚Äúteacher pay for performance,‚Äù ‚Äúteacher effects,‚Äù and maybe ‚Äúteacher collective bargaining agreements‚Äù as reasonable potential starting terms. Once you have your list, use it to search in premier academic journals on the topics (JPAM, PAR, JPART, AER, APSR and JHR are good outlets for this example) and in GAO, CRS, and CBO reports to cast a wide net of potential information. I also recommend searching think tanks like Brookings Institute, Urban Institute, Niskanen Center, NBER Working Papers, and CBPP. I recommend searching directly at the journal‚Äôs websites or, in GoogleScholar, type the search term then add source:‚ÄúJournal Title‚Äù to the search. I recommend using year filters in Google Scholar to get both older and newer research on the subject. Read the abstracts and executive summaries to think about even a loose fit with what you are doing to narrow the number of papers to what‚Äôs most relevant. Now you have a collection of literature to draw on for informing your background section.\n\n\n\n\nPolicy/Program Alternatives Considered\nThis section will include subsections for each of the three alternative proposals (the status quo, their proposed solution, an alternative you introduce for consideration) for advising your client on a solution for the problem you chose to help solve. Each proposal should be 3-4 pages and should include 1) an overview and justification of the status quo situation or policy proposal, 2) a short overview of the proposal‚Äôs costs (both direct and indirect, such as opportunity costs or negative externalities) and benefits, 3) a stakeholder analysis of 3-4 main stakeholders impacted by the proposed policy, and 4) the political costs and benefits of the proposal based on your stakeholder analysis. You may use no more than 3 tables, in text, in each proposal subsection. Tables should fit on one page, include a title above them, and be discussed in the text to aid reader understanding and complement the proposal narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Costs, Benefits, and Politics\n\n\n\nWhen discussing costs and benefits, use your research to create grounded and defensible estimates. If, for instance, one externality is pollution, do not simply list pollution as an externality; instead, be specific about the kind of pollution, the health care costs related to exposure to that pollution, the estimate number of people subject to exposure-related health issues, and the estimated economic cost of that exposure. Treat benefits similarly - look at the same proposed policy in other places and any research documenting benefits, then estimate the benefits of your proposal using population or scale differences in your client‚Äôs context. Finally, when doing your stakeholder analysis, be sure to quantify some of the political angles - how many voters will be affected positively versus negatively? Which stakeholders have power and what kind of power, financial resources, and commitment to the issue do they have?\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the Trade-offs and Recommendation\nThe final section will be a 3-5 page analysis of the three plans in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and political impact of each plan leading to your final recommendation. As with the background and related research section, this section should include some research on how to define and measure these dimensions of each plan and anchor your recommendation in how each plan compares on these four dimensions. In the introduction, the nature and history of the problem you are tackling and your goals in solving it should have been articulated clearly and will help you gauge each proposed alternative proposals against those goals and priorities.",

    "text": "Clients and Policy Problems\nYou will have 3 options to choose from as a group. On the first day of class (August 26th), you will find a brief survey in Brightspace that will ask about your general availability for group collaboration and your client/policy problem preference to work on for the semester. I will do my best to assemble groups based on both availability and client preference, but, of course, I cannot guarantee that everyone will have perfect alignment. Below, I provide a description of your three options for clients/policy issues and some basic background materials to get you started (all of these problems have a great deal of literature for review and related issues to research).\n\nMaking the City Move\nThe Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) 2020-2024 capital projects of needed infrastructure maintenance, upgrades, and accessibility improvements throughout the subway system in NYC is budgeted at $54.8 billion. Approximately $15 billion of the capital project budget was funded through both direct and indirect funds raised by the introduction of congestion pricing - a toll on drivers - in New York City‚Äôs central business district. Prior to implementation of the congestion pricing program, Governor Hochul paused implementation, creating a $15 billion shortfall in MTA‚Äôs capital projects budget. The governor has promised to ensure the shortfall is covered, possibly even using congestion pricing in some form.\nYour team is to advise the governor on how to cover the budgetary shortfall for the MTA‚Äôs capital projects fund. Since congestion pricing has been signed into law, you will need to devise two alternative funding paths relative to the status quo legislation of implementing congestion pricing, compare the three approaches, and make a recommendation based on your analysis to the governor.\nStatus quo: Implement the congestion pricing program in the authorizing legislation.\n\nBackground materials\nCurrent budget overview: MTA; Comptroller statement and report on budget shortfall direct impact and impact on the MTA cost of debt. Environmental assessment of the congestion pricing plan.\n\n\n\nHousing and Affordability\nIn many places throughout the country, housing affordability has become a pressing issue. Both presidential candidates have noted housing affordability as a top problem to tackle. Your group will choose either presidential candidate as a client and craft a federal policy proposal to increase housing supply for their coming administration to implement. Note that you will be summarizing the status quo of policies shaping housing supply, focuing on federal policies, will also analyze the alternative for the client you choose, and will add a policy alternative of your own.\n\nBackground materials\nTo get an introduction to the problem, start with this report documenting the housing supply problem in the US. The GAO has covered the problem as well in a brief blog post and the left-leaning Center for American Progress has also provided a report on the problem.\nStatus Quo: Our current local, state, and federal system for approving and financing housing supply.\nKamala Harris policy alternative: See her campaign press release for her starting policy proposal.\nDonald Trump policy alternative: See his executive order from his previous administration.\n\n\n\nRevitalizing an Old Downtown\nThe Greyhound bus station in downtown Albany has reached its end of life and the city is in the process of considering redevelopment proposals. Recently, a group of developers proposed replacing the current station and surrounding parking lots with a complex of hotels, businesses, and apartments anchored by a Major League Soccer stadium. For this project, both MLS and the NWLS have announced support for establishing teams if a stadium is built.1 A task force has been created that includes the Mayor of Albany, representatives from Empire State Development, representatives of the Capitalize Albany Foundation, and the Albany County government to discuss plans and funding for redeveloping the downtown site, including the currently proposed soccer stadium-based use.\nThe task force has hired you to prepare a report comparing alternatives for re-developing the 8-acre site downtown, currently owned by the Capitalize Albany Foundation on behalf of the city. One of the proposals under consideration is the proposed MLS stadium and surrounding hotel, business, and housing units. You are to describe the status quo land-use and develop an additional policy alternative to consider for the site. Analyze the the plans and make a recommendation to the task force.\n\nBackground materials\nTo get a sense of the proposed stadium development, read these three articles. As a starting point for your research, you can find a review of research on stadium projects here.",
