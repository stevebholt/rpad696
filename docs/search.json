    "text": "üë®‚Äçüè´: Stephen Holt, Ph.D.\nüìÖ: Asynchronous Online with Synchronous Check-Ins\nüìß: sbholt@albany.edu\nüè´: Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm or by appointment - book here; in-person in Milne 324 or online in GatherTown.1\n‚òéÔ∏è: 518-442-3309\n\n\n\nThe mission of the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy Master of Public Administration (MPA) Program is to develop leaders, managers, and advanced analysts who excel in public service within government and across sectors. The MPA curriculum emphasizes the development of technical and managerial skills toward the responsible and ethical uses of discretion in the pursuit exemplary personal and organizational performance (see Section¬†1.6 for a list of the competencies). The MPA‚Äôs mission and curriculum reflects the faculty‚Äôs commitment to producing committed and engaged public servants whose actions embody public service ideals.\nRPAD 696 ‚ÄúIntegrative Capstone‚Äù is the culmination of this learning process. As such, during this course, students will apply the competencies, knowledge, and skills they have acquired throughout the program to a semester-long case study project in a fictional setting. Course assignments will require students to synthesize and apply skills and material from across the MPA curriculum, individually and in teams. Toward that end, students will be preparing a semester-long research report for a client that will detail the knowledge base about a particular policy issue, develop a description of the status quo and two policy alternatives, present data and evidence regarding the expected effects and costs of the alternatives, and conclude with a recommendation to the client.\n\n\nThe course materials will all be shared through the course Brightspace and this course site. The materials will generally be assignment instructions and helpful supplemental materials.\n\n\n\nAs a capstone class, this class is centered around two primary assignments:\n\nAn individual assignment to produce a segment of the analysis for the case study final report.\nA group assignment to produce a final report - a section of which will be drawn from the individual assignment.\n\nAs with all online courses, there is not a weekly meeting time and your group work will be conducted and coordinated with each other. However, unlike most online courses, this course is ensuring an application and synthesis of program skills and materials. As a result, there are not weekly modules. Instead, when the course transitions to the group assignment (March 1st), groups will be expected to meet with the instructor bi-weekly to provide a progress report on their capstone work. The final report will be developed in segments and the bi-weekly check-ins will ensure groups are on track and receive the advice and instruction they need. Groups will sign-up for 30 minute office hour blocks using the link in the header (or here). For any particular meeting, groups can either designate an attendee to bring the update to office hours and pass on feedback or attend as a group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an individual, students will write two 1-2 page (single spaced, 12 point Times New Roman font) memos based on the final report they are making to the client. Each memo should be targeted at two different stakeholders - one that will be supportive of the recommendation and one that may be oppositional to some or all of the recommendation you are making. Your memo should be structured to summarize your report and final recommendations, but should be tailored to the specific stakeholder in how the information is presented. The individual assignment will be due December 2nd alongside the and details for completing the assignment will be provided on Brightspace and the course site during the first week of classes.\n\n\n\nThe group assignment will have four deliverables: 1) a group roles contract (details will be provided on Brightspace) submitted for instructor review (due September 30th); 2) an outline of the group‚Äôs approach to the case (due October 14th); 3) the final research report (due December 2nd); and 4) a group final presentation video, which can be done as a recorded Zoom with screenshare for slides and a polished presentation from all members (due December 2nd).\n\n\n\nThe course grade consists of:\n\nGroup contract: 10 points\nFinal report: 30 points\nIndividual assignment: 30 points\nPresentations: 20 points\nPeer evaluations: 10 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nAssignment\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n9/30\nGroup Roles Contract and Client Selection Due\n\n\n\n10/7 or 10/8\nFirst Group Check-In\n\n\n\n10/14\n1-page outline of group appraoch\n\n\n\n10/21 or 10/22\nSecond Group Check-In\n\n\n\n12/2\nFinal Report, Presentation, and Individual Assignment Due\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNOTE: I will be adding materials to both the Brightspace and the Course site on working in groups, delivering presentations, and the expectations for the final report. I will post announcements to the class when such updates and materials are posted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\nLetters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\nI have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\nHAVE FUN! Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\nThe table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\nStudents with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNOTE: Throughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n\n\nTable.

Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies, visit the site.\n\n\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students.

The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies prohibit offenses defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), sexual exploitation, and stalking. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies apply to the entire University at Albany community, including students, faculty, and staff of all gender identities.

    "text": "Details\nYour submission will involve three sections: a 1-page memo outlining your budget proposal, a 2-page summary of the major stakeholders that will be relevant to the budget decisions you‚Äôve made, and a 3-page summary of how you will engage your stakeholders.\n\nBudget Memo\nIn your one page budget memo, you need to briefly and precisely establish two things. First, you need to outline where all of the cuts to the operating budget will be coming from and how you anticipate services to be impacted. Second, you need to explain why those areas were identified for reduction. Note that if you make any other accompanying changes to the budget, those should include those in this memo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Budget Creativity\n\n\n\nWhile budgets are not often thought of as expressions of high art, as you have hopefully learned throughout your time here, there is room for creativity in public budgeting. When making decisions, note that it‚Äôs possible to reduce some areas more than necessary and use the additional reduction to invest new resources somewhere else even in a time of overall budget reductions. Just a useful (though not required or always needed) tool to keep in mind.\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder Analysis\nIn RPAD 500 (Foundations of Public Administration), you almost certainly read the Eden and Ackermann (1998) chapter on stakeholder analysis. Here, you will once again be thinking about stakeholders using their framework - identify the four most important stakeholders given your budget proposal while considering their power to raise opposition or support to your efforts and their interest in the outcome of the final budget. In your analysis, be sure to detail the basis on which you are assessing each stakeholder‚Äôs power and interest and whether they will be opponents or supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhile this is based on a fictional case, remember that it was designed on real-world cases. When considering stakeholders‚Äô power and interest, do some research to ground your assessments. In similar budget situations, who tends to be most vocal and powerful according to research? How do similar groups behave or react in similar situations in other cities? What typically gets their support? A good analysis will ground itself in concrete measures and ways to think critically about the world.\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nAlso in RPAD 500, you likely read Fung (2003) and created a plan for engaging stakeholders before. In this assignment, you will once again be rolling out a plan for engaging your stakeholders. You will provide details about a schedule of meetings, outreach, a timeline for feedback and how feedback will be used, where and when meetings will be held, and how those meetings will be structured. More importantly, you will need to link this plan and its details to your budget goals and analysis of your stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Strategic Engagement\n\n\n\nOne way to ensure productive engagement is to have a plan going in for how you will handle opposition. Identify some aspects of your budget proposal that are negotiable without activating too much opposition elsewhere. Another important aspect of strategy is clarifying and articulating what you hope to get out of the engagement. Is this collecting feedback or trying to bring awareness and context to a decision? Your approach should align with what you hope to get out of the engagement.",

    "text": "Details\nThis section lays out the sections that should be included in your 20 page (or less) report plus a one-page executive summary, in order, with details on expectations for each section. Overall, the format should use APA citation formatting (for both in-text citations and references list), 12-point Times New Roman font, and single-spaced. The first page should be a cover sheet with a title and all group member names clearly printed.\n\nExecutive Summary\nThis section does not count toward your page count. The report must include a 1-page, single-spaced summary of the full report. The summary should lay out the problem, guiding principles for the solution, the three alternative approaches considered, and finally, the final recommendation. Be clear and concise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMany students find summarizing their extended research in a limited space challenging, but such summarizing is an important skill to build. A big part of being prepared in a professional role is doing all the work to get to your answer, knowing how you got to your answer well enough to answer clarifying questions, and identifying for yourself and others what is truly important for making a particular decision. Remember that in this context, there‚Äôs a full report detailing your process and thinking that will follow the summary; it‚Äôs okay for the summary to leave details out to get to the bottom-line points.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nA 1-2 page introduction that should resemble the executive summary, but with added details on how you approached the problem and how the remainder of the report is structured. A good introduction should provide readers a clear understanding of how you are defining the problem, how you are proposing to resolve the problem, how you are weighing solutions, and the process by which you analyzed your options. Note that professional reports are not mystery novels - readers should know your final conclusion by the end of the introduction.\n\n\nBackground and Related Research\nA 4-6 page summary of research that informs your decision-making. Your research should center on what the evidence says about managing cutbacks and budget reductions, what has been successful in similar cases in other areas, and any evidence that informs the approach(es) you are using in your management of the cutbacks. Do not quote articles or materials directly. Instead, summarize the literature in your own words with citations to works appropriately placed throughout the text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Research Basics\n\n\n\nA good approach to doing the background research is to create a list of broad, general search terms that inform the basic themes of what you are doing (in this case, ‚Äúbudget cuts,‚Äù ‚Äúcutback management,‚Äù ‚Äúcontracting,‚Äù ‚Äúlayoffs,‚Äù and ‚Äúcollective bargaining agreements‚Äù are all reasonable potential starting terms). Once you have your list, use it to search in premier academic journals on the topics (JPAM, PAR, JPART, ROPPA, APSR and PMR are good outlets for this assignment) and in GAO, CRS, and CBO reports to cast a wide net of potential information. I recommend searching directly at the journal‚Äôs websites or, in GoogleScholar, type the search term then add source:‚ÄúJournal Title‚Äù to the search. I recommend using year filters in Google Scholar to get both older and newer research on the subject. Read the abstracts and executive summaries to think about even a loose fit with what you are doing to narrow the number of papers to what‚Äôs most relevant. Now you have a collection of literature to draw on for informing your background section.\n\n\n\n\nProposals Considered\nThis section will include subsections for each of the three alternative proposals for dealing with the cuts that were analyzed and considered by your team. Each proposal should be 3-4 pages and should include 1) an overview and justification of the plan, 2) a short overview of the cuts, 3) a stakeholder analysis of those affected, and 4) a timeline and plan for engaging stakeholders. You may use no more than 3 tables, in text, in each proposal subsection. Tables should fit on one page, include a title above them, and be discussed in the text to aid reader understanding and complement the proposal narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEach of you has completed an individual assignment that largely reflected the pieces required of the alternative proposals section. Unless all of you have taken the exact same approach in your individual assignments, it is entirely appropriate and encouraged for you to adopt an edited, polished, and more concise version of your individual assignment as subsections here. You will want to not only revise for space constraints, but also revise for tone, voice, and narrative flow with the rest of the report. You may also, through discussion with one another, make tweaks to the plan.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the Trade-offs and Recommendation\nThe final section will be a 3-5 page analysis of the three plans in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and political impact of each plan leading to your final recommendation. As with the background and related research section, this section should include some research on how to define and measure these dimensions of each plan and anchor your recommendation in how each plan compares on these four dimensions. In the introduction, the goals and priorities driving your management of the parks department (and thereby influencing your budgetary priorities) should have been articulated clearly and will help you gauge each proposed alternative budget plan against those goals and priorities.",

Each group should plan on exchanging individual assignments with one another to inform group discussion on which plans (or pieces of plans) should be incorporated as part of the three alternative proposals considered in the assignment. I also highly recommend groups assigning the editing role to who they believe to be a strong writer in the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole\nResponsibility\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction, Executive Summary, and Editor\nWrite the Executive Summary and Introduction.  Suggest edits and revisions to other sections strictly for flow and cohesion.  Edit and provide one of the three proposed plans.\n\n\nBackground and Related Research\nWrite the background and related research section.  Edit and provide one of the three proposed plans (if relevant).\n\n\nAnalysis and Recommendation\nWrite the analysis and recommendation section.  Edit and provide one of the three proposed plans (if relevant).\n\n\nOne Proposed Plan\nEdit and provide on of the three proposed plans.  Aid with finding and organizing background research for the background and analysis sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs there are only 3 alternative plans needed and groups will have 4 members, one person will have their individual plan excluded. The author of the plan from the individual assignments that the group decides is either too similar to other plans or too different from other collectively decided goals or objectives to be included in the full report should take on either the background section or the analysis section. Thus, ‚Äú(if relevant)‚Äù above suggests that one of these roles may not have an alternative budget plan slated for revision and inclusion in the final report. This should never be taken as a suggestion of quality, but instead one of fit.\n\n\nTeams should plan to meet to assign roles, sign the group role contract, and submit the signed contract on Brightspace by midnight on March 8th.",
