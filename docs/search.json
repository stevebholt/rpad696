    "text": "👨‍🏫: Stephen Holt, Ph.D.\n📅: Asynchronous Online\n📧: sbholt@albany.edu\n🏫: Mondays and Thursdays from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm or by appointment - book here; in-person in Milne 324 or online in Zoom.\n☎️: 518-442-3309\n\n\n\nThe mission of the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy Master of Public Administration (MPA) Program is to develop leaders, managers, and advanced analysts who excel in public service within government and across sectors. The MPA curriculum emphasizes the development of technical and managerial skills toward the responsible and ethical uses of discretion in the pursuit exemplary personal and organizational performance (see Section 1.6 for a list of the competencies). The MPA’s mission and curriculum reflects the faculty’s commitment to producing committed and engaged public servants whose actions embody public service ideals.\nRPAD 696 “Integrative Capstone” is the culmination of this learning process. As such, during this course, students will apply the competencies, knowledge, and skills they have acquired throughout the program to a semester-long case study project in a fictional setting. Course assignments will require students to synthesize and apply skills and material from across the MPA curriculum, individually and in teams. Toward that end, students will be preparing a semester-long research report for a client that will detail the knowledge base about a particular policy issue, develop a description of the status quo and two policy alternatives, present data and evidence regarding the expected effects and costs of the alternatives, and conclude with a recommendation to the client.\n\n\nThe course materials will all be shared through the course Brightspace and this course site. The materials will generally be assignment instructions and helpful supplemental materials.\n\n\n\nAs a capstone class, this class is centered around two primary assignments:\n\nAn individual assignment to produce a segment of the analysis for the case study final report.\nA group assignment to produce a final report - a section of which will be drawn from the individual assignment.\n\nUnlike most courses, this course is ensuring an application and synthesis of program skills and materials. As a result, there are not weekly modules and not necessarily new skills or content taught week to week. Instead, we will follow a biweekly meeting schedule (see detailed course schedule below) and most meetings will allow for groups to coordinate their work in-person and ask any questions they might have of the instructor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the individual assignment, students are expected to write a memo (max 2 pages) detailing their project timeline, laying out and explaining the rationale for interim deadlines, and how they will coordinate with team members with overlapping responsibilities (e.g., communication expectations, meeting plans, etc.). This memo will be due October 13th alongside your 1-page outline of your plan for your group assignment.\nAt the end of the semester, students will then assess one other groupmate on their success in executing the project plan outlined in their memo. They will summarize that groupmate’s contributions to their substantive parts in the group assignment and their performance in upholding the project plan they outline in their memo. This will be due December 12 alongside peer evaluations.\n\n\n\nThe group assignment will have four deliverables: 1) a group roles contract (details will be provided on Brightspace) submitted for instructor review (due September 29th); 2) an outline of the group’s approach to the case (due October 13th); 3) the final research report (due December 10th); and 4) a group final presentation and a polished presentation from all members (due December 10th).\n\n\n\nThe course grade consists of:\n\nGroup contract: 10 points\nFinal report: 30 points\nIndividual assignment: 30 points\nPresentations: 20 points\nPeer evaluations: 10 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nAssignment\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n8/25\nFirst class - Introduction and Syllabus\n\n\n\n9/29\nGroup Roles Contract and Client Selection Due\n\n\n\n10/6\nWriting Literature Reviews\n\n\n\n10/13\n1-page outline of group appraoch\n\n\n\n10/31\nComparing Alternatives and Analysis\n\n\n\n11/14\nStakeholders and Political Analysis\n\n\n\n12/10\nFinal presentations, final reports due\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNOTE: I will be adding materials to both the Brightspace and the Course site on working in groups, delivering presentations, and the expectations for the final report. I will post announcements to the class when such updates and materials are posted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\nLetters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\nI have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\nHAVE FUN! Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\nThe table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\nStudents with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNOTE: Throughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n\n\nTable.

Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university’s academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university’s academic honesty policies, visit the site.\n\n\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students. This includes students with physical, sensory, medical, cognitive, learning, mental health, and other disabilities.

The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies prohibit offenses defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), sexual exploitation, and stalking. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies apply to the entire University at Albany community, including students, faculty, and staff of all gender identities.

The grade I is automatically changed to E or U unless work is completed as agreed between the student and the instructor.\n\n\n\nStudents are excused, without penalty, to be absent because of religious beliefs, and will be provided equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. Students should notify the instructor of record in a timely manner, and the instructor will work directly with students to accommodate religious observances. Online courses will not schedule any assignment deadlines on religious holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage teams and projects effectively, fairly, and with attention to detail.\nDisplay responsible stewardship of public resources and use of discretion by recognizing consequences of choices.\n\n\n\n\n\nInform the design, implementation, and/or evaluation of policy.\nIdentify and manage stakeholder interests and expectations within existing constraints to achieve policy goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse appropriate data and approaches to inform policy and management recommendations.\nClearly present and interpret findings from data analysis.\nCommunicate limitations from data collection and analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncorporate, where appropriate, the values of equity, accountability, and participation in decision-making and the evaluation of policies.\nFoster public trust by identifying and minimizing conflicts of interest and adhering to high standards of integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent information, in writing and orally, that is concise, accurate, clear, and informed by evidence.\nTailor information to diverse audiences."

Here, you will once again be thinking about stakeholders using their framework - consider your two stakeholders regarding their power to raise opposition or support to your efforts and their interest in the outcome of the final recommendation. Your tailored messaging should be clearly aligned with the assessment of the stakeholders in your group’s report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhile you are not actually working with the clients chosen by your group, try to approach this as if you were and you are engaging important stakeholders on their behalf in messaging the recommended decision. When considering stakeholders’ power and interest, do some research to ground your assessments. In similar budget or policy situations, who tends to be most vocal and powerful according to your research? How do similar groups behave or react in similar situations in other cities or states? What typically gets their support? A good analysis will ground itself in concrete measures and ways to think critically about the world.",

    "text": "Details\nIn the following, I lay out the sections that should be included in your 20 page (or less) report plus a one-page executive summary, in order, with details on expectations for each section. Overall, the format should use APA citation formatting (for both in-text citations and references list), 12-point Times New Roman font, and single-spaced. The first page should be a cover sheet with a title and all group member names clearly printed.\n\nExecutive Summary\nThis section does not count toward your page count. The report must include a 1-page, single-spaced summary of the full report. The summary should lay out the problem, guiding principles for the solution, the three alternative approaches considered, and finally, the final recommendation. Be clear and concise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMany students find summarizing their extended research in a limited space challenging, but such summarizing is an important skill to build. A big part of being prepared in a professional role is doing all the work to get to your answer, knowing how you got to your answer well enough to answer clarifying questions, and identifying for yourself and others what is truly important for making a particular decision. Remember that in this context, there’s a full report detailing your process and thinking that will follow the summary; it’s okay for the summary to leave details out to get to the bottom-line points.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nA 1-2 page introduction that should resemble the executive summary, but with added details on how you approached the problem and how the remainder of the report is structured. A good introduction should provide readers a clear understanding of how you are defining the problem, how you are proposing to resolve the problem, how you are weighing solutions, and the process by which you analyzed your options (e.g., what data did you use? what criteria were policies judged against?). Note that professional reports are not mystery novels - readers should know your final conclusion by the end of the introduction.\n\n\nBackground and Related Research\nA 4-6 page summary of research that informs your decision-making. Your research should center on what the evidence says about the policy problem your client is tackling (e.g., the effects of congestion and current congestion rates; housing supply and housing affordability nationally; or current land-use and economic activity in a downtown area), the evidence regarding the status quo and the two policy alternatives you are weighing (your client’s and the additional alternative), what has been successful in similar cases in other areas/cities/states/countries, and any evidence that describes the size and direction of effects of these policies to anchor your own projections later in the report. Do not quote articles or materials directly. Instead, summarize the literature in your own words with citations to works appropriately placed throughout the text.\nThis section should close with a table or figure that describes the problem as it stands now or in recent years using data you download and analyze yourself, and your should write a clear description of the problem using insights from the table and data. Note that you should also describe the data - what data did you use? what years? where did you get it from? what variables did you include? - in this last part of this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Data\n\n\n\nThe Current Population Survey, American Community Survey, and other similar data from Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics will likely be good sources. For local or state government issues, you may have to look around city or state government sites or identify only data from the relevant cities or states in the national datasets listed above. These data can be found on the Census website or, more readily for your needs, on IPUMS (for instance, the IPUMS CPS can be found here but a Google search for “IPUMS ACS” or “IPUMS NHIS” will bring up the IPUMS repository of those government datasets as well). This analysis can be as simple or as sophisticated as you like - I just would like to see you apply the analytic skills learned in your data analysis classes in the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Research Basics\n\n\n\nA good approach to doing the background research is to create a list of broad, general search terms that inform the basic themes of what you are doing. For example, if researching a new effort to assign bonuses to good teachers, I would include: “teacher effectiveness,” “teacher pay,” “teacher pay for performance,” “teacher effects,” and maybe “teacher collective bargaining agreements” as reasonable potential starting terms. Once you have your list, use it to search in premier academic journals on the topics (JPAM, PAR, JPART, AER, APSR and JHR are good outlets for this example) and in GAO, CRS, and CBO reports to cast a wide net of potential information. I also recommend searching think tanks like Brookings Institute, Urban Institute, Niskanen Center, NBER Working Papers, and CBPP. I recommend searching directly at the journal’s websites or, in GoogleScholar, type the search term then add source:“Journal Title” to the search. I recommend using year filters in Google Scholar to get both older and newer research on the subject. Read the abstracts and executive summaries to think about even a loose fit with what you are doing to narrow the number of papers to what’s most relevant. Now you have a collection of literature to draw on for informing your background section.\n\n\n\n\nPolicy/Program Alternatives Considered\nThis section will include subsections for each of the three alternative proposals (the status quo, their proposed solution, an alternative you introduce for consideration) for advising your client on a solution for the problem you chose to help solve. Each proposal should be 3-4 pages and should include 1) an overview and justification of the status quo situation or policy proposal, 2) a short overview of the proposal’s costs (both direct and indirect, such as opportunity costs or negative externalities) and benefits, 3) a stakeholder analysis of 3-4 main stakeholders impacted by the proposed policy, and 4) the political costs and benefits of the proposal based on your stakeholder analysis. You may use no more than 3 tables, in text, in each proposal subsection. Tables should fit on one page, include a title above them, and be discussed in the text to aid reader understanding and complement the proposal narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Costs, Benefits, and Politics\n\n\n\nWhen discussing costs and benefits, use your research to create grounded and defensible estimates. If, for instance, one externality is pollution, do not simply list pollution as an externality; instead, be specific about the kind of pollution, the health care costs related to exposure to that pollution, the estimate number of people subject to exposure-related health issues, and the estimated economic cost of that exposure. Treat benefits similarly - look at the same proposed policy in other places and any research documenting benefits, then estimate the benefits of your proposal using population or scale differences in your client’s context. Finally, when doing your stakeholder analysis, be sure to quantify some of the political angles - how many voters will be affected positively versus negatively? Which stakeholders have power and what kind of power, financial resources, and commitment to the issue do they have?\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the Trade-offs and Recommendation\nThe final section will be a 3-5 page analysis of the three plans in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and political impact of each plan leading to your final recommendation. As with the background and related research section, this section should include some research on how to define and measure these dimensions of each plan and anchor your recommendation in how each plan compares on these four dimensions. In the introduction, the nature and history of the problem you are tackling and your goals in solving it should have been articulated clearly and will help you gauge each proposed alternative proposals against those goals and priorities.",

    "text": "Clients and Policy Problems\nYou will have 3 options to choose from as a group. On the first day of class (August 25th), you will find a brief survey in Brightspace that will ask about your general availability for group collaboration and your client/policy problem preference to work on for the semester. I will do my best to assemble groups based on both availability and client preference, but, of course, I cannot guarantee that everyone will have perfect alignment. Below, I provide a description of your three options for clients/policy issues and some basic background materials to get you started (all of these problems have a great deal of literature for review and related issues to research).\n\nRe-purposing A Campus\nThe College of Saint Rose, in the Pine Hills neighborhood of Albany, New York, closed permanently in 2024. The campus features a variety of buildings, some relatively new and recently updated, that can be re-purposed. In light of the footprint even smaller colleges and smaller campuses have in their surrounding communities, ensuring the Saint Rose campus finds a new life is a top priority for Albany elected officials. The county purchased the campus in March of 2025.\nYour team is to advise the county executive and mayor on how to manage and re-purpose the Saint Rose campus.\nStatus Quo: Minimal maintenance and security of the empty campus provided by the county government.\n\nBackground materials\n-Coverage of the Purchase\n\n-Background About the Campus\n\n\n\n\nFunding Higher Education and Affordability\nHigher education has long served a multitude of policy purposes: providing basic research that yields government and commercial applications, creating economic growth in their local communities, and providing pathways in the labor markets of varying industries to name just a few. In recent decades, the cost of higher education has been a rising policy problem confronting both parties. More recently, the Trump administration has also focused on federal funding streams to colleges and universities. You are working as part of a consultant team hired to provide your client of choice a recommendation for policy priorities regarding the future role of federal funding in higher education.\n\nBackground materials\nTo get an introduction to the problem, start with this set of background readings on recent trends in the federal role in higher education funding:\n-Urban Institute\n\n-National Council of State Legislatures\n\n-USA Facts\n\nStatus Quo: The federal government’s current role in funding higher education.\nDemocratic party (if you choose this client):\n-House Democrats’ Proposed Higher Education bill\n\n-Center for American Progress Vision for Higher Education Policy\nRepublican party (if you choose this client):\n-American Enterprise Institute Vision for Higher Education\n-Summary Reporting on Higher Education portion of BBB\n-Executive Order on Research Grants\n-Nature Coverage of Executive Order\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFederal policy can be a little bit abstract and indirect. The tools available are often somewhat constrained. A lot of the challenge in this scenario will be defining clearly the policy objective in higher education you would like to focus on in your policy alternatives and designing them accordingly both when optimizing the client’s proposal and designing your own.\n\n\n\n\n\nRevitalizing an Old Downtown\nRecently, Governor Hochul announced the Championing Albany’s Potential (CAP) program and included a budgeted $200 million dollars in investments being made available for revitalizing downtown Albany. You have been appointed to lead a task force for developing proposals for how to best spend the money by identifying three proposed alternative plans. These can range from transit and transportation projects to business investments to housing and other redevelopment investments. There are some existing ideas, existing issues in the community, and existing priorities that you will want to consider and incorporate in each of your plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe status quo for this scenario does not exist as a policy. Thus, there should be some description of the current state and issues in the targeted area in the background section, but there will need to be three new alternatives proposed rather than a description of the effects of the status quo.\n\n\n\nBackground materials\nInformation about the proposed grant can be found here:\nDowntown Albany Strategy\nTo get a sense of the proposed stadium development, read these three articles. As a starting point for your research, you can find a review of research on stadium projects here\nYou do not need to feel bound to include the stadium proposal as an alternative. However, drawing on some of the aims it hopes to address might help inspire and fuel alternatives that you do consider.",
