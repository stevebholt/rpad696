## Overview
For the individual assignment, you are expected to write a memo (max 2 pages) detailing your project timeline, laying out and explaining the rationale for interim deadlines, and how you will coordinate with team members with overlapping responsibilities (e.g., communication expectations, meeting plans, etc.). Your plan should include reference to roles and responsibilities from the group contracts and consider issues such as communication with other members of your team and fairness in the distribution of both the formal and informal work of the project. This memo will be due *October 13th* alongside your 1-page outline of your plan for your group assignment.

At the end of the semester, you will then assess one other groupmate on their success in executing the project plan outlined in their memo. You will summarize their contributions to their substantive parts in the group assignment and their performance in upholding the project plan they outline in their memo. This will be due *December 12* alongside peer evaluations.
